  My Practice Environment
</h1>

- My Repo for practicing/learning programming languages & frameworks.


## ‚ùîHow to use (I use) this repo?

- First fork this repo.
- Then clone your forked repo using **Git**.
  <details>
    <summary>Steps Here</summary>
     For Linux (make sure git is installed):-

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Practice-Environment.git
      ```
     For Windows (altough I recommend to try using Linux):-
      - First install git from [here][1]
      - Then clone:-

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Practice-Environment.git
      ```
  </details>

- Now open the cloned `Practice-Environment` folder in your IDE (I am & recommend using VS Code/Zed).
- Open the specific dirs according to your need (like if you want to learn Python, open `Python` dir).
- You can also clone my Repo directly but I recommend to fork this repo first & then clone because it will give more flexibility (if I upload anything new, you can just sync upstream from GitHub..).


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Some Tips & Sources(that I follow):-

- [Here][2] are some useful shortcuts.
- Use Replit if your pc doesn't have sufficient computing power.
- You can use the Practice exercises to practice (although I haven't crerated much).
- You can take some help from AI if you cannot find your problem in code even after hard trying. BUT DON'T GET TOO DEPENDENT AT IT.
- Learn how to use Git, it will help you in future.
- I recommend you to try & start using Linux, it's much more flexible than windows....
